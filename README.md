- 👋 Hi, I’m Kegan
- 👀 I’m interested in Front-End development and C# .NET engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about neural networks and deep learning. I'd like to apply these concepts to bionformatics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects that utilize microservices to do interesting, cool, and useful things with data.
- 📫 How to reach me, contact kgoo2@asu.edu
- Due to the academic overlap of my projects with ASU, they're primarily private since other students can access github and essentially grab code.
