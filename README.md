- 👋 Hi, I’m Kegan
- 👀 I’m interested in Front-End development, C# .NET engineering, Embedded systems, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, BioInformatics, and my own personal app! (Also Tennis and Volleyball)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about neural networks and deep learning. I'd like to apply these concepts to bionformatics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects that utilize microservices to do interesting, cool, and useful things with data.
- 📫 How to reach me, contact kgoo2@asu.edu
- Due to the academic overlap of my projects with ASU, they're primarily private since other students can access github and essentially grab code. All of my projects will be released upon my graduation in May of 2023.
